# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing operational and financial data for a small startup airline based in Chicago, Illinois. The airline's management team has extensive experience in operations but lacks expertise in financial and data analysis. The airline's data systems are disconnected, making it difficult to extract key insights efficiently.
As a data consultant, my goal is to leverage Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to analyze the airline's data, identify trends, and provide data-driven recommendations for business growth.
